1. 🔄 BIDIRECTIONAL WAL ENHANCEMENT:
   - Log ALL writes to PostgreSQL (regardless of target instance)
   - Track instance state at write time
   - Replay to recovered instances based on their downtime
   
2. 🔗 CHROMADB NATIVE REPLICATION:
   - Rely on ChromaDB's internal replication mechanisms
   - Let ChromaDB handle replica sync automatically
   - WAL only for primary failover scenarios
   
3. 🕐 TIMESTAMP-BASED SYNC:
   - Track last sync timestamp per instance
   - Query primary for changes since replica went down
   - Implement smart catch-up sync on recovery
   
4. 📋 DUAL WAL TABLES:
   - wal_primary_pending (for primary recovery)
   - wal_replica_pending (for replica recovery)
   - Separate monitoring and replay logic
