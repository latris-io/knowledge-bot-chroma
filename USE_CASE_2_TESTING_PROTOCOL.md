# üö® USE CASE 2 Testing Protocol - PERMANENT SAFEGUARDS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This Document Contains Permanent Testing Protocol

**This file exists to prevent accidental USE CASE 2 testing without proper manual setup.**

### üõ°Ô∏è **Why These Safeguards Exist**

USE CASE 2 (Primary Instance Down) testing simulates **real infrastructure failures** and requires:
1. **Manual primary instance suspension** via Render dashboard
2. **Actual infrastructure downtime** (not simulated)
3. **Timing-sensitive testing** during real failure scenarios
4. **Production CMS validation** during actual outages

**Running USE CASE 2 tests without proper setup gives false results and doesn't validate real-world failover.**

---

## üîß **Permanent Safeguards Implemented**

### **1. Dedicated Manual Testing Script**
```bash
# REQUIRED for real USE CASE 2 testing
python use_case_2_manual_testing.py --manual-confirmed
```

**Built-in safeguards:**
- ‚úÖ Requires explicit `--manual-confirmed` command line flag
- ‚úÖ Interactive confirmation prompts (4 separate confirmations required)
- ‚úÖ Automated health verification (REFUSES to run if primary is still healthy)
- ‚úÖ Clear step-by-step manual instructions embedded in the script
- ‚úÖ Timestamp logging of manual confirmations

### **2. Main Test Suite Modifications**
The `run_enhanced_tests.py` script now has permanent safeguards:

**Automated Test Protection:**
```python
# CRITICAL SAFEGUARD: If primary is actually down, redirect to manual protocol
if not primary_healthy:
    return self.log_test_result(
        "Write Failover - Primary Down (Automated)", 
        False,
        "üö® PRIMARY IS DOWN! Use manual protocol: python use_case_2_manual_testing.py --manual-confirmed",
        time.time() - start_time
    )
```

**Clear Warnings:**
- ‚úÖ Test method renamed to indicate it's "LIMITED AUTOMATED VERSION"
- ‚úÖ Docstring warnings about manual testing requirement
- ‚úÖ Startup warnings in main function about USE CASE 2 protocol
- ‚úÖ Result messages include manual testing reminders

### **3. Documentation Protection**
- ‚úÖ This permanent documentation file (`USE_CASE_2_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md`)
- ‚úÖ Updated `USE_CASES.md` with manual testing protocol
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between automated and manual testing

## üìã **USE CASE 2 Testing - Step by Step**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER Skip These Steps**

#### **Step 1: Understand the Requirement**
- USE CASE 2 tests **actual infrastructure failure**
- Requires **manual primary instance suspension**
- Cannot be automated or simulated accurately
- **Must use real Render dashboard controls**

#### **Step 2: Manual Primary Suspension**
1. **Go to your Render dashboard** (https://dashboard.render.com)
2. **Find the `chroma-primary` service**
3. **Click "Suspend"** button
4. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for health detection

#### **Step 3: Run Manual Testing Script**
```bash
# Use the dedicated manual testing script
python use_case_2_manual_testing.py --manual-confirmed
```

**The script will:**
- ‚úÖ Check your understanding of manual requirements
- ‚úÖ Confirm you suspended the primary instance
- ‚úÖ Verify timing (30-60 second wait)
- ‚úÖ Validate primary is actually down before testing
- ‚úÖ Run comprehensive CMS operation testing during failure
- ‚úÖ Guide you through primary restoration and sync verification

#### **Step 4: Primary Restoration**
1. **Go back to Render dashboard**
2. **Find the `chroma-primary` service**  
3. **Click "Resume" or "Restart"**
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for WAL sync completion
5. **Verify sync worked** (documents created during failure appear on primary)

## üö´ **What NOT To Do**

### **‚ùå DON'T Use Automated Tests for USE CASE 2**
```bash
# THIS GIVES FALSE RESULTS - DON'T DO THIS
python run_enhanced_tests.py --url https://chroma-load-balancer.onrender.com
```
**Why:** Automated tests cannot simulate real infrastructure failures and timing gaps.

### **‚ùå DON'T Skip Manual Confirmation**
```bash
# THIS WILL FAIL - SAFEGUARDS PREVENT IT
python use_case_2_manual_testing.py
# Error: SAFEGUARD: This test requires explicit confirmation
```
**Why:** The `--manual-confirmed` flag ensures you understand the requirements.

### **‚ùå DON'T Run Without Primary Suspension**
The script will detect and refuse:
```
üö® CRITICAL ERROR: Primary instance is still healthy!
   This indicates the primary was NOT properly suspended.
üõë REFUSING TO RUN TEST - Primary must be suspended first
```

## üîÆ **Future-Proofing (3+ Years From Now)**

### **These Safeguards Are Code-Based, Not Memory-Based**

**Permanent protections that will work regardless of AI system changes:**

1. **Script-Level Safeguards** 
   - Manual testing script requires explicit flags and confirmations
   - Health verification prevents accidental execution
   - Interactive prompts cannot be bypassed

2. **Code-Based Protections**
   - Main test suite redirects to manual protocol when primary is down
   - Clear method naming indicates automated vs manual testing
   - Built-in warnings and documentation in code comments

3. **Documentation Redundancy**
   - Multiple documentation files explain the protocol
   - Step-by-step instructions embedded in scripts
   - Clear separation of automated vs manual testing approaches

### **For Future Developers**

**If you're reading this in 2027+ and need to test USE CASE 2:**

1. **Read this entire document first**
2. **Understand this is not optional - USE CASE 2 requires manual setup**
3. **Use the manual testing script: `python use_case_2_manual_testing.py --manual-confirmed`**
4. **Don't try to bypass the safeguards - they exist for good reasons**

**The safeguards will guide you through the proper process even if the AI system has changed.**

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

**USE CASE 2 testing validates your CMS can handle real infrastructure failures:**

- ‚úÖ **File uploads continue** when primary instance crashes
- ‚úÖ **File deletions work** when primary instance is down  
- ‚úÖ **Zero data loss** when primary instance is restored
- ‚úÖ **WAL sync recovers** all operations that happened during failure

**Only manual testing with actual infrastructure suspension can validate these critical production scenarios.**

---

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter issues with USE CASE 2 testing:

1. **Check this documentation first**
2. **Verify you followed the manual protocol exactly**
3. **Ensure you actually suspended the primary instance via Render dashboard**
4. **Wait the full 30-60 seconds for health detection**
5. **Use the manual testing script with `--manual-confirmed` flag**

**The safeguards are designed to prevent issues, not create them. Work with them, not around them.**
